# Contributing to IFM-Ruta

Thank you for your interest in contributing to IFM-Ruta! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (stable, beta, or nightly)
- Git
- A code editor (VS Code, Cursor, or similar)

### Getting Started

1. **Fork and clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ifm-ruta.git
   cd ifm-ruta
   ```

2. **Set up the development environment**:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   cargo build
   
   # Run tests
   cargo test --workspace
   
   # Check formatting
   cargo fmt --all -- --check
   
   # Run clippy
   cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
   ```

3. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow Rust naming conventions (snake_case for variables, PascalCase for types)
- Use `cargo fmt` to format code
- Use `cargo clippy` to check for linting issues
- Write self-documenting code with minimal comments
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibility

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Follow TDD (Test-Driven Development) principles
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Add integration tests for MCP protocol changes

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Document public APIs with rustdoc comments
- Update examples and usage instructions
- Keep documentation concise and clear

### Architecture

- Follow the established trait-based architecture
- Keep core system minimal and focused
- Use dependency injection where appropriate
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
